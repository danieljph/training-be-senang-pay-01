     * Starting with version 5.5.13, the RedisLockRegistry exposes a setRedisLockType(RedisLockType) option to determine in which mode a Redis lock acquisition should happen:
     * - RedisLockType.SPIN_LOCK - the lock is acquired by periodic loop (100ms) checking whether the lock can be acquired. Default.
     * - RedisLockType.PUB_SUB_LOCK - The lock is acquired by redis pub-sub subscription.
     * <br/>
     * The pub-sub is preferred mode - less network chatter between client Redis server, and more performant - the lock is acquired immediately when subscription is notified about unlocking in the other process.
     * However, the Redis does not support pub-sub in the Master/Replica connections (for example in AWS ElastiCache environment), therefore a busy-spin mode is chosen as a default to make the registry working in any environment.
